# About
With this extension you can watch youtube shorts just as any other regular video. </br>
When you open "Shorts" video this extension automatically redirects you to normal video view.</br>

# Installation
On firefox</br>

I recommend installing it from firefox extension workshop: [link](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/yt-shorts-to-video/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search)</br>

Alternative way is to install it manually, but you have to do this every time you open browser</br>
1 - Download the extension from [here](https://github.com/Arhyved/YT-shorts-to-video-convert/releases/tag/1.0)</br>
2 - Open firefox debugging page : about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox</br>
3 - Press "Load Temporary Add-on..."</br>
4 - Select downloaded extension</br>

# Addition
If you didn't get redirected to regular player than simply refresh page or open "Shorts" video in new tab.</br>
